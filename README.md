# MSCS532_Assignment6

## Part 1
This project focuses on implementing and analyzing algorithms that efficiently find the kthk^{th}kth smallest element in an array using both deterministic and randomized approaches. 
## Files
- 'Deterministic Select' : Implementation for selection in worst-case linear time. 
- 'Emperical Analysis.py' : Python code to draw comparison and graph between deterministic and randomized select algorithms.
- 'Performance Comparison.png' : Graph of the performance analysis. 
- 'Randomized Select' : Implementation for selection in expected linear time.
- 'Report - Part 1.docx': Report detailing design choices, implementation details, and analysis.
  
## Part 2
This project focuses on implementing fundamental data structures—arrays, stacks, queues, and linked lists—while analyzing their performance and exploring their practical applications in real-world computing scenarios.
## Files
- 'Elementary Data Structures (Implementation & Analysis).py' : Implementation of various data structures using Python, as well as its analysis. 
- 'Performance Analysis.png' : Graph of the performance analysis.
- 'Report - Part 2.docx': Report detailing design choices, implementation details, and analysis.
  
## How to Run
1. Clone the repository using the command: https://github.com/prashcodes10/MSCS532_Assignment6. There are two separate folders for Part 1 and Part 2. 
2. Make sure python is already installed in the system. 
3. Run the codes.
